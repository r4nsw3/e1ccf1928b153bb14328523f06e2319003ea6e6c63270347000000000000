  |   The definitive 99Vidas experience! More Stages, More Enemies, More    |
  |   Game Modes!                                                           |

  |   '99Vidas' is a brawler set in a contemporary world, that pays         |
  |   tribute to both the classic and the new in the gaming industry.       |
  |   Brought to you in 16-bit pixelated glory, chock-full of references    |
  |   to not only gaming but also 80's and 90's pop culture. '99Vidas'      |
  |   takes full advantage of modern era gameplay mechanics, making it      |
  |   the best of both worlds.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The game features 11 playable characters and multiple cooperative     |
  |   and competitive game modes, for up to four players, which can be      |
  |   played either locally or online.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Each of these characters has unique attributes, like speed and        |
  |   strength, as well as an elemental alignment (Fire, Water, Wind,       |
  |   Lightning...), which modify their regular attacks, combos and         |
  |   special moves. Different from more traditional games in the genre,    |
  |   characters gain experience points by defeating enemies and            |
  |   collecting special items which can then be used by the player to      |
  |   upgrade their abilities and combos, or even unlock new ones.          |
  |                                                                         |
